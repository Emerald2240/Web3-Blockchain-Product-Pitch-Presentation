Government Public Funds/Package Distribution Monitoring/Accountability Project



This is a web based Blockchain app that tries to boost government accountability by letting all citizens worldwide publicly view details about Government projects. These projects include Citizen package distribution, Salary Payments, Government contract payments and so on.



This will be achieved through the use of the Blockchain and it's immutability. The Government is mandated to upload valid data about their activities to the blockchain, once uploaded they can be viewed and retrieved when need be by anyone, anywhere through the app.



This approach will help boost accountability for the government in that all required info is stored securely and cannot be manipulated or changed by anyone. An example of this is in package distribution; no citizen can receive dues twice because the data can be retrieved and confirmed accurately in the Blockchain. Another example is in the case of curbing corruption; no money can be moved secretively or in a fraudulent manner because all transactions are recorded automatically and available to all.



The project will help make the lives of the average Nigerian better because funds will be better spent for things they were meant to be and all records will be securely kept for years without risk of loss or damage or manipulation.
