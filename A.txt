According to the study "Challenges of accountability and development in Nigeria: An auto-regressive distributed lag approach published under the Journal of Money Laundering Control ISSN: 1368-5201 Article publication date: 30 March 2020 Reprints & Permissions Issue publication date: 18 May 2020

The Nigerian Government has taken several actions to address the problems of bad governance and corruption that have impeded economic development, but unfortunately these measures have not yielded the desired results. The results from the study found that control of corruption and political power has a direct and significant effect on Nigeria’s economic development. For Nigeria to experience development, corruption should be eliminated, and the Nigerian Government should spend on viable projects and economic activities that will be beneficial to the populace and the society at large and hence bring about economic development. Accountability is the hallmark of a prudent government that ensures efficient management of resources and transparency in the utilization of funds by the government. The absence of accountability mechanisms allows corruption to thrive, which hinders the developmental process.
